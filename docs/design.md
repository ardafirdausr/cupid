## MVP

### Software Architecture

#### High Level Design

The software architecture will be a monolithic architecture. The reason for choosing a monolithic architecture is because it is easier to develop and deploy. The app is also small enough that a monolithic architecture is sufficient.

### Data Design

This is the ERD for the MVP version of the app. The app will have 2 entities: User and Subscription.

- The user has one to many relationships with the subscription. In this relationships, the user can have multiple subscriptions but only one subscription can be active at a time. Also this relationship also has attributes to store the user's subscription purchase.
- The user has many to many relationships with the user. In this relationships, the user can have multiple users that they have swiped on and multiple users that have swiped on them. This relationship also has attributes to store the user's swipe status.

#### Technical Stack

- **Programming Language:** Go  
  The reason for choosing Go is because it is a statically typed language that is easy to read and write.
- **Database:** MongoDB
  In this usecase which the data is not relational, structure is not fixed, and does not require ACID properties, MongoDB is a good choice because it is a NoSQL database that is easy to scale horizontally. It is also a good choice because it is a document-based database which means it is easy to store and retrieve data.

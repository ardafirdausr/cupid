## Software Architecture

The software architecture will be a monolithic architecture. The reason for choosing a monolithic architecture is because it is easier to develop and deploy. The app is also small enough that a monolithic architecture is sufficient.

## Technical Stack

- **Programming Language:** Go  
  The reason for choosing Go is because it is a statically typed language that is easy to read and write. It is also a compiled language which means it is faster than interpreted languages like Python.
- **Database:** MongoDB
  In this usecase MongoDB is a good choice because it is a NoSQL database that is easy to scale horizontally. It is also a good choice because it is a document-based database which means it is easy to store and retrieve data.
